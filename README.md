1. TITLE: Healthilicious - Personalized Meal Plan

   IDEA DESCRIPTION: Due to hectic schedule, it becomes difficult for people to select an ideal meal for their healthy diet and moreover it is difficult for them to know what nutrients are appropriate for their health related goals. The application will ask users about its preferences such as kind of fruits, vegetables and cereals they want to have and amount of nutrients they want to intake. Based on a clustering algorithm different meal plans will be formed into clusters and mapped to users preference and other methods onto one cluster. Users will receive recommendations and on selection of a plan users will receive information such as ingredients, how fast meal can be cooked and its nutritious contents. The application will map on different features and then map on the meal plan.
   
   GOAL: Users should have healthy meals according to their body requirements and according to their preferences.
   
   TECHNOLOGIES: Python

2. TITLE: Feed-Me-Back conditional APPROVED read below

### I would rather make it an interview preparation app where interview will be scheduled and interviewer will provide feedback which will be analyzed in aggregate for a user. Even survey questions for interviewer should be dynamically generated based on resume and job requirements - talk to me more.. 
   
   IDEA DESCRIPTION: While interviewing candidates, it is necessary that hiring decisions must include clear communication with them. A basic etiquette is to provide a constructive and productive feedbackto the candidates irrespective of whether you hire them or not.  Interviewers will be asked to fill a short survey/feedback form for that candidate. The answers will be recorded and this dataset will be turned into data driven narratives using Natural Language Generation.

These narratives will be sent as post-interview communication in the form of feedback to the candidates. The idea and goal here is to help both, Interviewers and Candidates. Interviewers being busy with  conducting a large number of interviews each day, this technique will help them send personalized emails to each candidates describing what went well in the interview and what are the skills they need to be good at for such positions. 
   
   GOAL: The constructive feedback will help the candidates know what are their strong and weak points and what do they need to do to hone their skills for similar kind of job positions.
   
   TECHNOLOGIES: PyTorch, NaturalOwl, Natural Language Generation (NLG)

3. TITLE: ParkIn
   
   IDEA DESCRIPTION: According to the studies conducted, motorists have been spending almost 17 hours in a year in search for car spots on the streets or garages. The hunt adds up to an estimated $345 per driver in wasted time, fuel and emissions, according to the analysis by INRIX, a leading specialist in connected car services and transportation analytics. This problem has been rising in the Bay area due to increasing number of cars and parking spots not increasing at the same rate. To solve this issue, real time images will be fed into our system and identify available spots using Machine Learning Model and notify the drivers.
   
   GOAL: We propose a model which monitors parking areas and lets the drivers know about the availability.
   
   TECHNOLOGIES: Python, Tensorflow

4. TITLE: Drowsy Driver Detector
   
   IDEA DESCRIPTION: The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that drowsy driving was responsible for 72,000 crashes, 44,00 injuries and 800 deaths in 2013. Our system will be detecting drowsiness of a driver in real time and notify him with an alarm in order to alert him.
   
   GOAL: We propose a model which monitors drivers’ face gestures and wakes him up from sleep in case he/she dozes of.
   
   TECHNOLOGIES: Python, Raspberry Pi
